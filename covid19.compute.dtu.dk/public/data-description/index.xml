      <description>Movement Maps For understanding How people move we use so-called &amp;ldquo;Movement Maps&amp;rdquo;, which are provided by the Facebook&amp;rsquo;s Data for Good initiative. Specifically, we use a combination of Movement maps at tile level and administrative region level (see Granularity and Further preprocessing).
Description: A Movement map seperates the country into different areas. It then reports the number of users that travel between areas, for three eight hour time windows each day.</description>

      <description>Population Density Maps For understanding Where people are we use &amp;ldquo;Population Density Maps&amp;rdquo;, which are provided by the Facebook&amp;rsquo;s Data for Good initiative. Specifically, we use Population density maps at the tile level (see Granularity).
Description: A Population density map seperates the country into different areas, and for each it counts the number of users that spend most of their time there, for three eight hour time windows each day. For example, for the 08â€“16 (working hours) time window on May 4, there may be 52.</description>

      <description>Movement maps using telco data These data show the number of daily trips between Danish Municipalities, estimated from aggregated mobile phone data provided by four large telecommunication companies. The purpose of the data is to study changes in mobility behaviour following the interventions introduced by the Danish government in response to the COVID-19 pandemics. Data covers the period from 1. February of 2020.
Statistical presentation The data includes the daily number of trips between pairs of municipalities.</description>

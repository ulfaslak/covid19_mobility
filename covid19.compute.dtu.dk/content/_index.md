# **Mobility in Denmark during COVID-19 lockdown**

> {{< lastmod >}}

An immediate national lockdown occurred in Denmark on Thursday the 12th of March 2020 as a measure to mitigate the spread of coronavirus. The lockdown proceeds to be in place, but the restrictions are partly relaxed over time.

*In what ways does the corona lockdown impact people's travel patterns and where they spend their time?*

On this site, we share the **newest results and insights** into mobility and space use of the Danish population, gained by the COVID-19 behavioral-response group led by Sune Lehmann. In a broad sense, we address the **overall questions**:
* *Where are people spending time during the lockdown?*
* *How do people move around inside the country during the lockdown?*
* *How do these behaviors change over time and in response to decisions of reopening parts of the country?*

Because behavior is expected to change with time, and this change in behavior is of primary interest, we continuously offer **two kinds of insight**:
* *Data visualizations*, that are highly interactive and continuously updated.
* *Posts* where, from time to time, we offer reflections on the newest data.

← See **Posts** and **Visualizations** in the panel on the left.

Our results reveal e.g. how much new relaxations like opening child-care affects the amount of people that go back to work, and in general how close things are to being back to normal. New results and insights are added continuously, so please check back for updates or follow us on Twitter (handles: @ulfaslak, @lau_retti, @jonassjuul, @anna_Sapienza, @suneman).

We use large-scale behavioral data provided by Facebook's [Data For Good](https://dataforgood.fb.com) initiative for our analysis. The data is highly aggregated and contains no information about the behavior of individuals.

← See **Data** in the panel on the left, for detailed descriptions of the datasets we use.
